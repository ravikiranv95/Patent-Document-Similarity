       "'Apparatus for heating a window A grid of heating conductors for defrosting applied to the window of a vehicle is connected to a source of electrical energy through a relay-operated switch. This switch is closed either in response to a drop in the resistance between two conductors or electrodes mounted in spaced relation on an insulatingort such as the window (the drop occurring by accumulation of moisture on theort and between the conductors) or in response to a drop in temperature at or near the window. For this purpose the resistance between the two conductors over the surface of theort may be paralleled by a thermostatic switch which closes with drop in temperature, both this resistance and the thermostatic switch being in the input to a trigger circuit controlling the relay to energize it in response to a decline in resistance at that input. Alternatively the trigger circuit may include thermistors which sense the drop in temperature and set the trigger circuit to the condition which energizes the relay. Apparatus for heating a vehicle window comprising a plurality of heating conductors applied to the window, a switch for connection of said conductors to a source of electrical energy, first means to close said switch in response to the presence of water at a first location adjacent the window, and second means at a second location to close said switch, independently of the operation of said first means, upon appearance of a temperature below a specified value at said second location, wherein said second location is inside the vehicle at a region sheltered from the space heater of the vehicle and which reflects the temperature existing in the vicinity of said window.,Apparatus for heating a vehicle window comprising a plurality of heating conductors applied to the window, a switch for connection of said conductors to a source of electrical energy, first means to close said switch in response to the presence of water at a first location adjacent the window, and second means at a second location in said vehicle to close said switch upon appearance of a temperature below a specified value at said second location, said second location being one which is sheltered from the space heater of the vehicle, being one which is adjacent an outer all of the vehicle, and being one where the atmospheric conditions reflect those existing in the vicinity of the window which bears the conductors.,Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein said first means comprise two electrodes disposed in spaced apart relation on an insulatingort and means responsive to a decline in the resistance between said conductors to close said switch.,Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said electrodes are disposed on the surface of said window facing the inside of the vehicle.,Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said second means to close said switch comprise a thermostatic switch.,Apparatus according to claim 5 wherein said thermostatic switch is connected in parallel with said two electrodes.,Apparatus according to claim 6 wherein said electrodes and thermostatic switch are connected in the input circuit of an amplifier controlling said first-named switch.,Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said means responsive to a decline in resistance include an amplifier receiving as input a signal varying inversely in amplitude with the value of said resistance and having its output connected to control said first-named switch, and wherein said second means to close said first-named switch comprise at least one resistor having a large temperature coefficient of resistivity connected with said amplifier to vary the gain thereof inversely with the temperature of said resistor.,Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said means responsive to a decline in resistance includes an amplifier receiving as input a signal varying inversely with the value of said resistance and having its output connected to control said first-named switch, and wherein said second means to control said first-named switch comprises a thermistor of positive temperature coefficient, a thermistor of negative temperature coefficient, and means connecting said thermistors into a feedback loop of said amplifier.'"

       "'Electrically heated vehicle window A humidity-responsive heating circuit for a window of an automotive vehicle includes a grid of heating conductors on the window and two conductors closely approaching each other on the surface of the window such that the resistance between them changes, upon the appearance of humidity bridging the space between them, sufficiently to provide a signal. All of the conductors are composed of the same paste having the same properties and are applied as a single baked, silk screen printed pattern. The circuit may further include a switch to apply a voltage between those two conductors, amplifying means responsive to change of resistance between them, and a relay controlled by the amplifying means for connection of the heating grid to a source of voltage.
